# BATTLECODE HACKATHON

1-minute setup:
- Download a copy of this repository [here](TODO) or fork / clone it
- Install a recent version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (> 8)
- Open a terminal / command prompt
- Run `npm install -g @battlecode/battlehack`
    - If you're on linux, you might need `sudo`
- Run `battlehack start`; leave that terminal running; make sure that `http://localhost:8080/` has opened in your browser
- Open a new terminal; `cd` into the [`python`](https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-hackathon/python) directory; run `python player.py`
- Now do that again in a third terminal
- You should now be able to watch a game run in your browser
- Open `player.py` and start hacking!

## Other languages
- Java:
    TODO
- Other:
    Technically, we support other languages, but you'll have to do a lot more work to use any of them.
    Talk to the devs for more information.
