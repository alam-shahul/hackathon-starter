# BATTLECODE HACKATHON
Welcome to the battlecode hackathon!

## 1-minute setup:
- Download a copy of this repository [here](https://github.com/battlecode/hackathon-starter/) or fork / clone it.
- Install a recent version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (> 8). If you already have Node installed, you can check which version you have with `node --version` in your terminal.
- Open a terminal / command prompt.
- Run `npm install -g @battlecode/battlehack`.
    - If you're on linux, you might need `sudo`.
- Run `battlehack start` and leave that terminal running. Make sure that `http://localhost:8080/` has opened in your browser.
- Open a new terminal; `cd` into the [`hackathon-starter/python`](https://github.com/battlecode/hackathon-starter/tree/master/python/) directory and run `python player.py`.
- Open a third and last terminal; `cd` into the [`hackathon-starter/python`](https://github.com/battlecode/hackathon-starter/tree/master/python/) directory and run `python player.py` again.
- You should now be able to watch a game run in your browser.
- Open `player.py` and start hacking!
